# Color Palette Generator

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React.js to create a Color Palette Generator with the following criteria: 

1) Have a "Randomize Colors" button
2) Show 5 colors on the screen
3) Each color should have a hex code and a "LOCK/UNLOCK" button
4) Clicking the "Randomize Colors" buton should only randomize the colors of the unlocked sections

A live demo is available at https://jhkillam.github.io/color-palette-generator/. 

## Future Development Plans

- Implement an algorithm to generate palettes that are more complimentary.
